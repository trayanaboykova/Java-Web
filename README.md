**HTTP Protocol**: <br>
In this lesson, I learned about the HTTP protocol and how it plays a fundamental role in web applications. I explored the concept of embedded web servers and gained an understanding of how HTTP facilitates communication between clients and servers through requests and responses. I also studied different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and learned about the importance of idempotency in ensuring safe and predictable operations. Additionally, I covered MIME types, which help the server and client understand the nature of the data being exchanged.
