**[HTTP Protocol](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/Spring-Fundamentals/tree/main/HTTP%20Protocol/java-web-http-protocol-demo-master)**: <br>
In this lesson, I learned about the HTTP protocol and how it plays a fundamental role in web applications. I explored the concept of embedded web servers and gained an understanding of how HTTP facilitates communication between clients and servers through requests and responses. I also studied different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and learned about the importance of idempotency in ensuring safe and predictable operations. Additionally, I covered MIME types, which help the server and client understand the nature of the data being exchanged.

**Spring Core**: <br>
In this lesson, I was introduced to the core concepts of the Spring framework and learned how Spring Boot simplifies the development of Spring-based applications. I explored the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection, which allow for better flexibility and decoupling of components in an application. I also learned about Spring Beans, their lifecycle, and how they are managed by the Spring IoC container. Additionally, I studied the layered architecture approach commonly used in Spring applications to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
